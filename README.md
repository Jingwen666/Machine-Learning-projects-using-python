#Project 1: Preprocessing and fiting KNN to UFO sightings dataset. In this project, I learned how to deal with data issues like missing data,and incorrect datatypes, how to standardize numerical values (scaling and log nomalization(log is useful on columns has very large variance which will affect model performance )) and process categorical ones(label encoding and one hot encoding),  how to engineer new features that will improve your dataset(extract useful infos from columns and creat new features), and finally, how to select features for modeling(try reduce redundant features to improve model performance). See projects for details.
#Project 2: Prediciting credit card approval. In this project, I apply machine learning (feature selection,hyperparameter tuning, etc),  data tranformation(label encoding,change date types) and data manipulation techniques, the outcome is a model that was able to predict the outcome of a credit applications with 84% accuracy
